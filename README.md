# Team Manager
A minecraft mod developed for **Void Event Hub** to manage scoreboard teams by giving players more power over team assignment, 
making it easier to play with friends.

## User interface
Pressing **z** will open the user interface. The user interface has 2 main features:

### Parties
Players can join each other into a party with up to 3 other players. Only the party leader can invite other players. 
The party leader can also kick players from the party. All members can leave the party.
Being in a party guarantees that all party members will be delegated to the same scoreboard team.

### Swap Teams
Players can send each other a swap request if both members are in a scoreboard team. 
this swaps the players' scoreboard teams.

## Commands
* `/teammanager assign` - Assigns all players to a scoreboard team, based on their party.
